<h1 align="center">📞 PhoneBook Application (Java)</h1>

<p align="center">
  <b>A console-based Java PhoneBook application built using TreeMap and LinkedHashSet.</b><br>
  Efficiently store and manage multiple mobile numbers for each contact.
</p>

---

## 🌟 Overview
This project is a **Java-based console application** that simulates a basic **PhoneBook system**.  
It allows users to store contact names along with one or more mobile numbers.  
Contacts are stored in **alphabetical order** automatically using `TreeMap`.

---

## ✨ Features
✅ Add multiple contacts  
✅ Store multiple mobile numbers for a single contact  
✅ Automatically sort contacts alphabetically  
✅ Avoid duplicate phone numbers using `LinkedHashSet`  
✅ View all stored contacts neatly  

---

## 🧠 Java Concepts Used
| Concept | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **TreeMap** | Stores contacts alphabetically by name |
| **LinkedHashSet** | Ensures no duplicate mobile numbers |
| **Map.Entry** | Used to iterate through all contacts |
| **Scanner** | For user input handling |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- ☕ **Java**
- 💻 **Eclipse IDE**

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE**
2. Ensure your file is named `PhoneBook.java` and inside the `src/project/` folder  
3. Run the program (`Run → Run` or `Ctrl + F11`)
4. Follow the prompts in the console:
   - Enter how many contacts to store  
   - Enter contact names  
   - Enter one or more mobile numbers  
5. The program displays all contacts in alphabetical order
